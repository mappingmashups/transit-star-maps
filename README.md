transit maps that look like constellations because trains + stars = &lt;3

What makes a good transit star chart?
-------------------------------------
 * The transit system needs to be complicated enough to be interesting. Sorry, [one-line systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_Light_Rail) are boring.
 * Not too complicated! Sorry, [hundreds of stations and dozens of lines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Subway) is more complicated than any constellation. It wouldn't look right.
 * Ideally some hierarchy of stations so we can use different sizes of stars. Maybe express vs local stops, or transfer stations could be larger stars, etc.
